# YouID
A NFC based unique identification and data management system

This project was developed as the Final Project for my undergraduation at the University of Pune, India.

NOTE: The project is no longer maintained. The project was built on Andorid Studio and this repository only contains the source files and resources used. 

# What is YouID about?

A part of the BioHacking domain, this project comprises of a bio-compatible NFC tag supposed to be implanted in the hands of a person. Each tag has a unique ID which is stored in the tag itself. This ID is linked to a cloud where the medical, criminal, personal history, etc. is stored. Whenever in need to access this information, simply scan the implanted tag of the person using a NFC compatible mobile phone or a NFC scanner and the respecive information will be made available.

For e.g. if a person visits a doctor and the doctor wants to know about the medical history of the patient, he/she can just scan the patients tag to access all the information.

As we're moving into a digital world, this project aims to move all the essential data of a person into a digital form. This would not only help eliminate the use of paper but also the hassle of carrying and storing all this information which always is a tedious task. 

# Future of YouID?

While developing this project, we focused on storing and accessing medical, criminal and personal information of a person. But is that it? No!

Our vision for YouID is to make it a all-in-one solution. What does that mean?

From unlocking your smartphone/computer, locking/unlocking your car/house, to using the ATM's or your credit/debit cards, to boarding a flight, and almost everything that requires an authentication/identification YouID can be integrated into everything.
